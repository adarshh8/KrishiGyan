STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

Project Name: Marketplace Offer Comparison Agent

1. Problem Statement

E-commerce brands sell on multiple marketplaces (Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Ajio, etc.).
But tracking competitors’: prices

discounts

coupon offers

bundles

stock availability


…across all platforms is manual, slow, and inaccurate.

This results in:

Late reaction to competitor promotions

Losing Buy Box to lower-priced competitors

Missing opportunities to improve conversions

Poor pricing strategy due to incomplete visibility


There is no unified dashboard that compares real-time offers from different marketplaces.

2. Proposed Solution

Create an AI-powered Marketplace Offer Comparison Agent that:

✔ Crawls multiple marketplaces for a given product

✔ Extracts prices, deals, coupons, stock status

✔ Normalizes data for easy comparison

✔ Highlights which competitor has the best offer

✔ Recommends pricing adjustments (match/beat)

The agent will work 100% automatically and send updates to a Slack/Email channel.
